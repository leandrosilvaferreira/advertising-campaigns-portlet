campaign-portlet-howto=This is the Advertising Campaigns management console. From here, you can create and edit all you adertising campaigns. A campaign displays once and only once a web content article taken from the global site to the loging-in user. After you have created a campaign, it remains inactive. You can then activate it by clicking the start button. You can pause a campaign or stop it. Pausing will temporarily disactivate the campaign until you click the start button back. Stopping the campaign will disactivate it and reset the campaign-user log so that when you start the campaign back again, users who formerly saw the last version of the campaign can see it once more.
